                <h2>Trout overview</h2>

                <p>Trout is a generic common name for numerous species of carnivorous freshwater ray-finned
                    fishes belonging to the genera Oncorhynchus, Salmo and Salvelinus, all of which are members of the
                    subfamily Salmoninae in the family Salmonidae. The word trout is also used for some similar-shaped but
                    non-salmonid fish, such as the spotted seatrout/speckled trout (Cynoscion nebulosus, which is actually a
                    croaker).</p>

                <p>Trout are closely related to salmon and have similar migratory life cycles. Most trout are strictly
                    potamodromous, spending their entire lives exclusively in freshwater lakes, rivers and wetlands and
                    migrating upstream to spawn in the shallow gravel beds of smaller headwater creeks. The hatched fry and
                    juvenile trout, known as alevin and parr, will stay upstream growing for years before migrating down to
                    larger waterbodies as maturing adults. There are some anadromous species of trout, such as the steelhead
                    (a coastal subspecies of rainbow trout) and sea trout (the sea-run subspecies of brown trout), that can
                    spend up to three years of their adult lives at sea before returning to freshwater streams for spawning,
                    in the same fashion as a salmon run. Brook trout and three other extant species of North American trout,
                    despite the names, are actually char (or charr), which are salmonids also closely related to trout and
                    salmon.</p>

                <p>Trout are classified as oily fish and have been important food fish for humans. As mid-level
                    predators, trout prey upon smaller aquatic animals including insects, crustaceans, baitfish and
                    tadpoles, and themselves in turn are also important staple prey items for many wildlifes including brown
                    bears, otters, raccoons, birds of prey (e.g. sea eagles, ospreys, fish owls), gulls, cormorants and
                    kingfishers, and other large aquatic predators. Discarded remains of trout also provide a source of
                    nutrients for scavengers, detrivores and riparian florae, making trout keystone species across aquatic
                    and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

                    <h3>Trout fishing regulations</h3>

                    <p>Just because trout are relatively abundant and available doesn’t mean that there are no regulations to
                        follow in landing them. One of the essentials of knowing how to fish is understanding the ins and outs
                        of the rules.</p>

                    <p>In some places, you’ll need to get a fishing license. Others will limit the open season for trout
                        fishing. Additional standards may be in place for things like the minimum length of the fish you catch
                        or daily limits for trout.</p>

                    <p>Some states also provide guidelines for catching and releasing trout. For example, New York’s Department
                        of Environmental Conservation outlines steps to reduce the chance of mortality of trout that are
                        released back into the water.</p>

                    <p>Before you head out for your trip, review all state and local laws and regulations to make sure you stay
                        in compliance.</p>

                    <h3>Where to fish for trout</h3>

                    <p>From rainbow and lake to brown and more, there are literally hundreds of different species of trout. As
                        such, the species can be found in every state in almost any freshwater spot, including streams, rivers,
                        creeks, ponds, and lakes. Whether wild or stocked, trout can be plentiful, making a great target
                        species, especially for those learning how to fish.</p>

                    <p>To find a good location for trout fishing, it’s a good idea to check out area sources. Many times, public
                        agencies like a state’s Division of Fish and Wildlife will publish fishing maps. Other good sources of
                        information include your local bait and tackle shop, fellow anglers, or online forums that discuss trout
                        fishing in the areas you want to fish.</p>

                    <p>If your preference is learning how to fish for trout in a lake, you have multiple options. Lakes make an
                        ideal spot because you can choose to fish from land or a boat, opening up lots of possibilities for your
                        adventure. And the lakes are often stocked with trout, one of the most commonly stocked species to make
                        your outing as rewarding as possible.</p>

                    <h3>The best gear for trout fishing</h3>

                    <p>One of the best things about fishing for trout is that the gear you need can be pretty minimal
                        compared to what’s required to catch other species. Since you will need basic gear, knowing how to
                        fish for trout can also be more economical than fishing for other species.</p>

                    <p>If using a rod, it’s best to pick a medium-weight one that’s about six or seven feet in length. Pair
                        it with a spinning reel and four or six-pound monofilament line. You’ll also need to stock up on
                        sinkers, swivels, hooks and bobbers. Another common way to catch trout is fly fishing.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to bait, even though they have great eyesight, trout are not particularly picky eaters
                        and will go for almost anything. Angles who are learning how to catch trout should experiment by
                        trying a variety of live bait options such as insects like crickets, since bug make up the majority
                        of the fish’s diet. Minnows, fish eggs and nightcrawlers are other common live choices. Artificial
                        baits like PowerBait are also becoming more popular when fishing for trout.</p>

                    <h3>Storing trout while fishing</h3>

                    <p>If you don’t catch and release your trout and want to enjoy what you hook for dinner, then it’s wise
                        to follow proper techniques for keeping trout fresh, especially if you are fishing in warm weather.
                        Start by cleaning the fish as quickly as possible. Then wipe it clean or rinse it with water. Store
                        it in a cooler packed with ice for the trip home, and enjoy!</p>
