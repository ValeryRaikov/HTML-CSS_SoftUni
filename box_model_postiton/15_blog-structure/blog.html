                <p><a href="#">Java</a> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as
                    few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
                    to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on
                    all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically
                    compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
                    computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level
                    facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection
                    and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
                </p>

                <p>Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming language
                    since then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub
                    and it is ranked fourth on TIOBE index as of October 2023. Although still widely popular, there
                    has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining
                    popularity.

                <p>As of September 2023, Java 21 is the latest version, which is also a long-term support (LTS) version.
                    Java 8, 11, and 17 are previous LTS versions still officially supported.

                <h4>History</h4>

                <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June
                    1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the
                    digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an
                    oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was
                    finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java
                    with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.
